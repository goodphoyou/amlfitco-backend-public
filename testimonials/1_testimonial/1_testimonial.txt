Walid Halty | CEO - Dvinci.co - Before doing this, I was trying to follow workout routines from apps on my phone, had tried other trainers and coaches, and had even tried working out every day twice a day doing the 75 hard challenge, eating 1500 cals per day, but still couldn’t get rid of my gut. I didn’t realize that on top of running my business, going low calories and overtraining was jacking up my cortisol. Since working with Mounir, I’m eating 2200-2400 calories per day, I lost 20 lbs, I’ve got abs, and my energy + performance are on a whole nother level. Thanks gain Mounir.
