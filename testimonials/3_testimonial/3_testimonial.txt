Marcus Gryttingslien | Entrepreneur - You’re the reason I kept working out. You were such an inspiration for me to begin with this. You helped me transform from an unathletic chubby guy, to a guy who people started looking up to. I’ve got many questions about how I did this, and how I keep my motivation. I am proud of myself. I’ve been lifting weights for 11 months now. I don’t know how to thank you, but I hope you know what you helped me do with my life.
