Jason Sell | Owner - Torrey Pines Martial Arts - As a busy father running a business, having a family with 2 kids, it’s great to be able to go to the gym and know exactly what I need to do to get results. I’ve always been physically fit but in recent years there’s been a lot of holes in that physical fitness, injuries, and I found myself at close to 20% bodyfat. Since working with Mounir, we’ve gotten me down from 19% bodyfat to 11% bodyfat and my weight has dropped from 201 lbs to 175 lbs over the last 90 days.
